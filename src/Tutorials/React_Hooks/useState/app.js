/* 
--- React useState Hook
- The React useState Hook allows us to track state in a function component
- State generally refers to data or properties that need to be tracking in an application

--- Import useState
- To use the useState Hook, we first need to import it into our component
- Example: At the top of your component, import the useState Hook

- N/B: We are destructuring useState from react as it is a named export

import { useState } from "react";
