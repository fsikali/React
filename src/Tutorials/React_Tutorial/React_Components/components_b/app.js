/* 
--- Function Component
- Here is the same example as above, but created using a Function component instead. 
- A Function component also returns HTML, and behaves much the same way as a Class component, 
  but Function components can be writtrn using much less code, are easier to understand, and will
  be preferred in this tutorial.  
- Example: Create a Function component called Car
*/  

function Car() {
    return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
}
