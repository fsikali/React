/* 
--- React ES6 Modules
-- Modules
- JS modules allow you to break up your code into separate files
- This makes it easier to maintain the code-base
- ES Modules rely on the import and export statements

--- Export
- You can export a function or variable from any file
- Let us create a file named person.js, and fill it with the things we want to export
- There are two types of exports: Named and Default

--- Named Exports
- You can create named exports two ways. In-line individually, or all at once at the bottom
- Example: In-line individually:
*/ 

export const name = "Flem"
export const age = 40
