--- React Props
- Props are arguments passed into React components
- Props are passed to components via HTML attributes
- N/B: props stands fro properties

--- React Props
- React Props are like function arguments in JS and attributes in HTML
- To send props into a component, use the same syntax as HTML attributes:

- Example: Add a "brand" attribute to the Car element:
- The component receives the argument as a props object:
*/

const myElement = <Car brand="Ford" />;
