/* 
--- What is React?
- React, sometimes referred to as frontend JS framework, is a JS library created by Facebook
- React is a tool for building UI components

--- How does React Work?
- N/B: React creates a VIRTUAL DOM in memory
- Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, React creates a virtual DOM in memory, where
  it does all the necessary manipulating, before making the changes in the browser DOM.
- N/B: React only changes what needs to be changed!
- React finds out what changes have been made, and changes only what needs to be changed
